# Configuration

Use upstream `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` variables for Playwright MCP behavior. Use `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` only for Cloak-specific bridge behavior.

The old `CLOAKBROWSER_MCP_*` variables are not supported.

## Bridge Options

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Bridge transport: `stdio` or `streamable-http`. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Streamable HTTP bind host. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_PORT` | `3000` | Streamable HTTP bind port. Use `0` for an ephemeral port in tests. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_ENDPOINT` | `/mcp` | Streamable HTTP endpoint path. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` | unset | Optional Bearer token required on Streamable HTTP requests. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_SESSION_BACKEND` | `memory` | Session metadata backend. Only `memory` is implemented in this release. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_SESSION_IDLE_TTL_MS` | `3600000` | Idle TTL for Streamable HTTP sessions. Expired sessions dispose their bridge and upstream child process. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HTTP_SESSION_MAX` | `32` | Maximum active Streamable HTTP sessions in one process. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BROWSER_ENGINE` | `cloak` | `cloak` uses the CloakBrowser binary. `playwright` skips Cloak-specific executable replacement. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HEADLESS` | `true` | Runs Chromium in headless mode. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR` | `.playwright-mcp` | Artifact directory for npm. Docker sets `/data`. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_MODE` | `stdout` | Upstream output mode, either `stdout` or `file`. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_TIMEOUT_ACTION` | `5000` | Default action timeout in milliseconds. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_TIMEOUT_NAVIGATION` | `60000` | Default navigation timeout in milliseconds. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VIEWPORT_SIZE` | upstream default | Browser viewport in `WIDTHxHEIGHT` format. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONSOLE_FALLBACK` | `true` | Enables the console message compatibility patch. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STEALTH_ARGS` | `true` | Adds CloakBrowser default stealth launch arguments. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTRA_ARGS` | unset | Comma-separated or JSON array of extra Chromium arguments. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_NO_SANDBOX` | `true` | Adds `--no-sandbox` and disables Chromium sandboxing. |

## Upstream Options

The bridge forwards `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` settings to upstream Playwright MCP. That includes upstream options such as:

- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BLOCKED_ORIGINS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FILE_ACCESS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONSOLE_LEVEL`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_IMAGE_RESPONSES`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_SNAPSHOT_MODE`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STORAGE_STATE`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_USER_DATA_DIR`

Refer to the upstream Playwright MCP documentation for the full upstream option surface.

## Streamable HTTP Sessions

Each Streamable HTTP MCP session owns its own bridge runtime and upstream Playwright MCP child process. The built-in `memory` session backend stores only metadata such as session ID, timestamps, expiry, and status. Browser state remains in the live upstream child process, and artifacts are still controlled by `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR`.

For horizontal scaling, run multiple server replicas behind a load balancer with sticky sessions keyed by the `mcp-session-id` header. Future Redis, Postgres, or SQLite backends can coordinate metadata and locks, but they cannot restore a live browser session after the process that owns it exits.

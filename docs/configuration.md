# Configuration

Use upstream `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` variables for Playwright MCP behavior. Use `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` only for Cloak-specific bridge behavior.

The old `CLOAKBROWSER_MCP_*` variables are not supported.

## Bridge Options

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BROWSER_ENGINE` | `cloak` | `cloak` uses the CloakBrowser binary. `playwright` skips Cloak-specific executable replacement. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HEADLESS` | `true` | Runs Chromium in headless mode. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR` | `.playwright-mcp` | Artifact directory for npm. Docker sets `/data`. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_MODE` | `stdout` | Upstream output mode, either `stdout` or `file`. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_TIMEOUT_ACTION` | `5000` | Default action timeout in milliseconds. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_TIMEOUT_NAVIGATION` | `60000` | Default navigation timeout in milliseconds. |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VIEWPORT_SIZE` | upstream default | Browser viewport in `WIDTHxHEIGHT` format. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONSOLE_FALLBACK` | `true` | Enables the console message compatibility patch. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STEALTH_ARGS` | `true` | Adds CloakBrowser default stealth launch arguments. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTRA_ARGS` | unset | Comma-separated or JSON array of extra Chromium arguments. |
| `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_NO_SANDBOX` | `true` | Adds `--no-sandbox` and disables Chromium sandboxing. |

## Upstream Options

The bridge forwards `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` settings to upstream Playwright MCP. That includes upstream options such as:

- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BLOCKED_ORIGINS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FILE_ACCESS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONSOLE_LEVEL`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_IMAGE_RESPONSES`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_SNAPSHOT_MODE`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_STORAGE_STATE`
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_USER_DATA_DIR`

Refer to the upstream Playwright MCP documentation for the full upstream option surface.
